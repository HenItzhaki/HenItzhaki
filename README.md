## Hi there 👋

### Senior DevOps Engineer

I love automation and making things work seamlessly with minimal intervention.

*My philosophy? Set it up once, then let the magic happen! 🎩✨*

🚀 "Lazy" DevOps is the best DevOps—automate everything, optimize workflows, and let the system run itself while you focus on the next big thing.

## Who I Am

An experienced Senior DevOps Engineer passionate about:
* ✅ Automation – Because manual work is boring.
* ✅ Cloud Infrastructure – Designing scalable and resilient solutions.
* ✅ Kubernetes – Managing workloads efficiently.
* ✅ Cost Optimization – Saving money without sacrificing performance.

## What I Do
* 🚀 Cloud & Infrastructure: AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), Terraform, Helm.
* ⚡ CI/CD & Automation: GitLab CI, ArgoCD, Jenkins, Karpenter
* 📊 Observability & Security: Prometheus, Grafana, Elastic Stack.
* 🛠 Infrastructure as Code: Terraform(Terragrunt), Crossplane.

## 🌐 Cloud Architecture in AWS
I design cloud solutions that are:
* ✅ Automated – Everything as Code (IaC).
* ✅ Self-Healing – Karpenter, Auto Scaling, Spot Instances.
* ✅ Secure – IAM Policies, OIDC Authentication, VPC Isolation.
* ✅ Cost-Optimized – RI, Savings Plans, Serverless Architectures.

📌 Set it up once → Let automation do the rest! 🚀
